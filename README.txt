The package includes the following tools:
 
MHB_EA 
The software tools implements a method aiming at pattern prediction and computation in networks of diffusively coupled Lurâ€™e systems. Interconnecting several globally asymptotical stable systems into a network via diffusion can result in a diffusion-driven instability phenomena, which may lead to pattern formation in coupled systems. As the oscillations can be shown to appear via a Hopf bifurcation, the describing function method can be used in order to replace a nonlinearity by its linear approximation and then to analyze the system of linear equations by means of the multivariable harmonic balance method. The software is based on an extension of this method to systems with a network structure. 

compute_manifolds 
Due to weak couplings, large time-delays, etc., a network of interconnected dynamical systems may exhibit a phenomenon of incomplete synchronization where some but not all systems behave synchronously. The phenomenon is called partial synchronization or cluster synchronization. To describe the pattern of partial synchronization, so-called partial synchronization manifolds are used, which are linear invariant subspaces of the state space. Based on a recently proposed existence criterion for partial synchronization manifolds in terms of the block structure of a reordered adjacency matrix, the software tool computes all partial synchronization manifolds in networks of systems interacting via linear diffusive delayed coupling, where both the cases of invasive and non-invasive coupling are considered. The software includes the additional feature of computing system matrices corresponding to the synchronization error dynamics, as well as the adjacency matrix of a reduced network corresponding to the dynamics on the partial synchronization manifold. 

TDS_HIOPT-NSE 
The software implements a novel methodology for the design of robust controllers for retarded and neutral-type time-delay systems, focusing on decentralized and overlapping fixed-order controllers for Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems. The methodology is grounded in a direct optimization approach and relies on the minimization of the spectral abscissa and H-infinity based cost functions, with respect to the controller or design parameters. The software can be applied to generic MIMO systems, where specifications on the structure of the controller are automatically translated in a sparsity pattern on the controller. For the design of decentralized controllers for a class of networks consisting of identical systems, the software can also exploit the network structure, thereby significantly improving computational efficiency and scalability with the number of subsystems. 

Dec_sampling_LTI 
This software tool concerns the stability analysis of decentralized sampled-data linear time invariant (LTI) control systems with asynchronous sensors and actuators. The case is considered where each controller in the decentralized setting has its own sampling and actuation frequency which translates to asynchrony between sensors and actuators. The software allows to compute bounds on the delays and the sampling rates in such a way that preservation of stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed.
